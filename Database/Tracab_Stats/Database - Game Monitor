The idea is to update the game monitor so that it no longer uses the STS Feeds but fetches its information out of our
stats database.

- The user should give their matchID as an input to the Game Monitor. As a consequence the monitor will search for all
    necessary information necessary to provide the team () and player information for this match.
    1.) Get matchID to receive the final lineups. Use final lineups to get both playing teams and a list of
        all active players.
    2.) Fetch team and player data for playing teams and only the players on their rosters.
        - Retrieve team_id out of lineups to get team data
        - Retrieve playerIDs for all active players and get their data out of the player_stats
    3.) Present the data in the Game Monitor

- Table Structures:
    team1_stats --Columns: Matchday, Season, Total Distance, Num. Sprints, Num. SpeedRuns
    league_stats --Columns: TeamId, Total Distance, Num. Sprints, Num. SpeedRuns
    player_stats --Columns: (MLS: ObjectID), DlProviderID, Matchday, Season, Total Distance, HighSpeed, Num. Sprints, Num. SpeedRuns
