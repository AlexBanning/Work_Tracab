The idea is to update the game monitor so that it no longer uses the STS Feeds but fetches its information out of our
stats database.

- The user should give their matchID as an input to the Game Monitor. As a consequence the monitor will search for all
    necessary information necessary to provide the team () and player information for this match.
    1.) Get STS-ID (currently only for MLS, DFL still on DlProviderID) to receive the final lineups. Use final lineups
        to get both playing teams and a list of all active players.
    2.) Fetch team and player data for playing teams and only the players on their rosters.
    3.) Present the data in the Game Monitor
