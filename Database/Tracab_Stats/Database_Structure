Tracab Stats-DB

Purpose of this DB should be to include basic stats for each team of the major leagues that are covered by Tracab.
Each league should have their own database file containing statistic-tables for each individual club.

LeagueX.db
| - team1_stats
    - Table that contains all kpi-values of team1 for each matchday of the season
| - team2_stats
| - team3_stats
| - ...
| - league_stats
    - Table that contains avg values for all KPIs of each team of the league
| - player_stats
    - Table that contains matchday values for all player KPIs for each player of the league


team1_stats --Columns: Matchday, Season, Total Distance, Num. Sprints, Num. SpeedRuns
league_stats --Columns: TeamId, Total Distance, Num. Sprints, Num. SpeedRuns
player_stats --Columns: (MLS: ObjectID), DlProviderID, Matchday, Season, Total Distance, HighSpeed, Num. Sprints, Num. SpeedRuns


To update the team stats tables and league_stats table the user should always put in the matchday/matchdays that they want
to update the tables with. A function that checks whether they are already in the tables and/or if the data is already
available on the NAS so one can actually perform the update.
